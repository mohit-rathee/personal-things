 https://web-chat.onrender.com
 
Here i created an online chat application. It uses websockets to communicate to server and provide an experience of real time communication.It allow's you to download your chats as a file(***.db).Now just upload that file ,and continue from where you left. (this is because your data might not be saved for long time where i hosted this app).At this point a significant feature is missing to chat uselessly.(but not for ever) You can use this project in your local area network instead of using emails and messages which rely on the network outside the network i.e. Internet
