1. Use async operations to fire multiple tasks with database concurently.
    HOW:
         *  we have to use asyncio and other database libraries to write 
            async code.
         *  But sqlite3 doesn't provide any libraries so we just need to write 
            simple async functions.
    CONS:
        A lot of hectic tasks to make it work.
        Prone to errors due to locking mechanism.

2.  With some compound SQL command if we can execute multiple operations with
    single call to database.
    PROBLEM:
         *  Even after successfully completing both tasks we need another call 
            to database to reflect changes to the ORM in our app's class.
    TIP:
         *  If we manually add that class and updated the database with new table
            then the reflection process should become fast as it only read and 
            see the changes between orm classes and database metadata.
